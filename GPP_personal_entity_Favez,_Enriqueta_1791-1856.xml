            <descriptiveNote>
                <p>The time period over which the Georgian papers spans includes the change from the Old Style dating system (Julian calendar, year beginning Lady Day [25th March]) to the New Style system (Gregorian calendar, year beginning 1st January). This change was implemented in Britain and her colonies in 1752 but was implemented throughout Europe at differing times in history.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of the Georgian Papers Programme Name Authority File, in EAC-CPF all dates given with no @localType attached are implicitly New Style; only those that are Old Style will include @localType="oldStyle".</p>

                <abstract>Enriqueta Favez (c. 1791 ‚Äì 1856) also known as Henriette Favez, was a Swiss physician and surgeon who practiced medicine in the Napoleonic Wars and in Cuba. Although female, Favez lived as a male surgeon for approximately four years in Cuba‚Äîa fact that culminated in a well-documented trial and expulsion from the Spanish territories. Following her expulsion, she lived the remainder of her life as Sor Magdalena, a nurse for Daughters of Charity Services in New Orleans, eventually rising to the position of Mother Superior for that congregation.</abstract>

                <biogHist> 
                    <abstract>Enriqueta Favez (c. 1791 ‚Äì 1856) also known as Henriette Favez, was a Swiss physician and surgeon who practiced medicine in the Napoleonic Wars and in Cuba. Although female, Favez lived as a male surgeon for approximately four years in Cuba‚Äîa fact that culminated in a well-documented trial and expulsion from the Spanish territories. Following her expulsion, she lived the remainder of her life as Sor Magdalena, a nurse for Daughters of Charity Services in New Orleans, eventually rising to the position of Mother Superior for that congregation.</abstract>
                    <p>According to Favez's own testimony, collected during a trial in Cuba, her parents died while she was an infant, and she was married to a French soldier at the age of 15 (c. 1806) by an uncle. Three years later, both her husband and infant daughter died. The former allegedly died in battle, the latter died for unknown reasons at eight days old.</p>
                    <p>Favez remained in Paris and took up the study of medicine at the Sorbonne, taking on the dress and identity of a male army officer with her deceased husband's rank. After Favez's graduation, she worked as a French army surgeon during the Napoleonic Wars, allegedly alongside her uncle, until she was captured by Wellington's forces in Spain, and imprisoned.</p>
                    <p>After the war, Favez left for Cuba. She was licensed by the medical board in Habana, and started a practice in Baracoa, then a small outpost in eastern Cuba. Her clients included the largely poor local population.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, Favez married an impoverished, mestizo woman from a neighboring town, Juana de L√©on. Although Juana was most likely aware of the fact that Favez was female, there is lingering speculation about whether Juana knew of that fact when they were married. Four years after her marriage to Juana, and successful integration into the elite in Baracoa, speculation about Favez' biological sex surfaced. Despite efforts to stem rumors, Favez was found inebriated, with her shirt unbuttoned, by a servant, who promptly informed the local authorities. Favez was arrested, imprisoned, and put on trial. The charges cited by the court included the illegal practice of medicine by a woman, fraud against the medical board and local authorities, and coercing a woman into disreputable marriage. Forcible examinations by local doctors revealed her sexual anatomy, and several accusatory letters allegedly written by Juana de L√©on surfaced throughout her trial. Historical documents at his trial record that she defended himself against the charges by stating that she was a male spirit in a female body. Favez was declared guilty, and her marriage to Juana de L√©on was annulled.</p>
