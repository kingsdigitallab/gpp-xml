            <descriptiveNote>
                <p>The time period over which the Georgian papers spans includes the change from the Old Style dating system (Julian calendar, year beginning Lady Day [25th March]) to the New Style system (Gregorian calendar, year beginning 1st January). This change was implemented in Britain and her colonies in 1752 but was implemented throughout Europe at differing times in history.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of the Georgian Papers Programme Name Authority File, in EAC-CPF all dates given with no @localType attached are implicitly New Style; only those that are Old Style will include @localType="oldStyle".</p>

            <biogHist>
                <abstract>Hannah Snell (23 April 1723 – 8 February 1792) was an 18th-century British woman who disguised herself as a man and became a soldier.</abstract>
                <p>Snell borrowed a man’s suit from her brother-in-law James Gray, assumed his name, and began to search for her husband, James Summes, who had abandoned her while she was pregnant with his child. She later learned that her husband had been executed for murder. According to her account, following the death of her daughter, on 23 November 1745, she joined John Guise's regiment, the 6th Regiment of Foot, in the army of the Duke of Cumberland against Bonnie Prince Charlie.</p>
                <p>She deserted when her sergeant gave her 500 lashes and moved to Portsmouth and joined the Marines. She boarded the ship Swallow at Portsmouth and sailed to Lisbon. Her unit was about to invade Mauritius, but the attack was called off. Her unit then sailed to India.</p>    
                <p>In August 1748, her unit was sent to an expedition to capture the French colony of Pondicherry in India. Later, she also fought in the battle in Devicottail in June 1749. She was wounded in the legs eleven times. She was also shot in her groin and, to avoid revealing her gender, she instructed a local woman to take out the bullet instead of being tended by the regimental surgeon.</p>
                <p>In 1750, her unit returned to Britain and traveled from Portsmouth to London, where she revealed her sex to her shipmates on 2 June. She petitioned the Duke of Cumberland, the head of the army, for her pension. She also sold her story to London publisher Robert Walker, who published her account, The Female Soldier, in two different editions. She also began to appear on stage in her uniform presenting military drills and singing songs. Three painters painted her portrait in her uniform and The Gentleman's Magazine reported her claims. She was honorably discharged and the Royal Hospital, Chelsea officially recognized Snell's military service in November, and granted her a pension in 1750 (increased in 1785), a rare thing in those days.</p>
